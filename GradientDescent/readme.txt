The purpose of these scripts is to practice implementing the gradient descent algorithms from scratch. It's easier to develop these algorithms in high-level programming languages like Octave/MatLab and work out the details before porting them into lower-level languages like Python, C/C++/C#. 

======================
Algorithms
======================
LinRegGD
   Linear regression gradient descent.
   User needs to input datafile name, set specified parameters

LogRegGD
   Logistic regression gradient descent	
   User needs to input datafile name, set specified parameters
   Algorithm works but is not yet robust enough to accurately predict interspersed data.
   Able to replicate accuracy obtained for sample dataset.

HousePrices.txt - housing prices in Portland Oregon
	Format: (size of house, sq ft), (# of bedrooms), price
